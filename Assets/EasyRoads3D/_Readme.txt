This package includes the EasyRoads3D demo scene and EasyRoads3D Pro tool.

It is recommended to import it in a new project first. Or it can be imported in your project if you want to use all assets. Otherwise assets can be exported / imported. 

The v3.1 scene includes featured zones with links to tutorials on our website, http://easyroads3d.com/tutorials.php

This demo package has the v3.3 beta imported which includes the Flex Connector. This v3.3 crossing type supports flexible angles and different road types. It is used in the new v3.2+ demo scene which is work in progress and will eventually replace the v3.1 demo scene.

The road network in both scenes is in Build Mode. To switch to Edit Mode and explore the roads, select the road network object in the hierarchy and press the"Back to Edit Mode" button in the Inspector.

The demo project also includes a variety of different road types and side objects which can be used in your own personal and commercial projects except for asset store packages. 

Please contact us for permission to use these assets in Unity asset store packages or for example open source Unity projects.   


Unity 2021.2 notes: For Unity 2021.2.x a separate package is included in this EasyRoads3D root directory. Although it should auto import, this package can also be imported manually.

3rd Party Assets used in the scene:
- Free: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/speedtree/free-speedtrees-package-29170
	Used as terrain tree prototypes: Broadleaf and Conifer

	Without this package you may see the warning: "A tree couldn't be loaded because the prefab is missing."
	Removing these missing tree prototypes from the terrain will fix that.


Troubleshooting:
- Slow Scene View window responsiveness has been reported in the past for the v3.1 scene, this was mainly caused by the Broadleaf and Conifer tree prefabs assigned to the terrain. Removing these tree prototypes from the terrain or replacing them with other prefabs should solve this.
